The source code contained within this directory expects to be compiled with
Qt support. (Qt is a C++ library and development environment available free of charge from http://www.trolltech.com)

This version has been compiled with version 4.3.1 of Qt


## Added by Michael Carden <mike.carden@gmail.com> 2 March 2009 ##

On Ubuntu, make sure that the qt4 libraries are installed:

sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools


Then, in the shotGunSource directory:

qmake-qt4 -project
qmake-qt4
make

Which should result in a shotGunSource binary that can be run by:

./shotGunSource
